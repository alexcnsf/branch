Forge is a mobile app built to help people build stronger connections through participating in shared outdoor activities together. Whether you’re into surfing, bouldering, backpacking, or anything else — Forge helps you find your community, connect with others, and discover new friends.

This project was created for the 5C 2025 hack-a-thon with the goal of promoting inclusive connection own our campus and in the wider world. Our mission is to empower meaningful human connection, re-establish a love for the outdoors, and bring communities together through technology.
