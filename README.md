# Forge 🔥 

Forge is a mobile app built to help people build stronger connections through participating in shared outdoor activities together 🧗‍♀️🏄‍♂️🥾. Whether you’re into surfing, bouldering, backpacking, or anything else — Forge helps you find your community, connect with others, and discover new friends 🤝🌿.

This project was created for the 5C 2025 Hack-a-thon 💻🚀 with the goal of promoting inclusive connection on our campus and in the wider world 🌎. Our mission is to empower meaningful human connection 🤗, re-establish a love for the outdoors 🌲, and bring communities together through technology 📱.
